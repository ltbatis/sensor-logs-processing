To jump to my results click [here](https://github.com/ltbatis/sensor-logs-processing/blob/main/src/shape_tech_test.ipynb) but if you want to execute by yourself just need to have the following files:
  - [equipment.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Q2krI3CUZgsL1uBMe0YLl21ij3pcNg8/view?usp=sharing)
  - [equipment_failure_sensors.log](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cLVJg02utFGF3WyiHYjH41n1dgcC-FPB/view?usp=sharing)
  - [equipment_sensors.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RuiHtyTfgA_F9V-rXo5i0lfcfDiJrPas/view?usp=sharing)

  In the following path of Google Drive:
  - MyDrive/Sharing/shape_data/

  No open the Notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and have fun.
